#

This chapter explains how to configure external access to your application from an external network (or from “outside” the cluster). Although it is possible to access your application directly via an IP address, this approach is discouraged. Instead, follow the instructions below to properly expose your application.

There are two main types of applications that can be exposed: **web-based applications** and **other applications**. The primary distinction between these types is their IP address requirements. Web-based applications share an IP address with other web-based applications, whereas other applications require a dedicated IP address for each service. Since the number of available IP addresses is limited, the web-based approach is preferred whenever possible.

Throughout this documentation, YAML fragments are provided. These YAML definitions should be deployed using `kubectl` as shown below:

```
kubectl create -f file.yaml -n namespace

```

where `file.yaml` contains the YAML definitions and `namespace` is the namespace where the application is running.

✅
Prerequisite

This guide assumes that your application (`Deployment`) is already deployed. If you are unsure, refer to the [Hello World example](../examples/helloworld).

---

## [Web-based Applications](#web-based-applications)

Web-based applications communicate using the `HTTP` protocol and are exposed using `Ingress` resources.

### [Overview](#overview)

The overall architecture is illustrated in the following figure:

![Networking](/_next/static/media/expose-overview.0b8ndwz1f3jte.svg)

To expose a web-based application, you need:

- A `Service` that binds a port to your application.

- An `Ingress` resource that exposes the `Service` to the Internet.

Assume we have an application running on port `8080`. First, we define a `Service`:

service.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: application-port
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: application

```

In this configuration:

- The `selector.app: application` must match the application label in the `Deployment`.

- The `application-svc` and `application-port` values are arbitrary names.

After creating the Service, we define an Ingress:

ingress.yaml

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: application-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz"
      secretName: application-dyn-cloud-e-infra-cz-tls
  rules:
  - host: "application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz"
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: application-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific

```

Here:

- The `service.name: application-svc` must match the metadata name of the `Service`.

- The `Ingress` exposes the application at the URL `application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`, which serves as the accessible endpoint (functioning as the “IP address” for reaching your application).

- If the domain is within `dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`, it will be registered automatically.

- The `tls` section enables automatic certificate management via Let’s Encrypt.

📌
Note

If the tls section is included, TLS termination occurs at the NGINX Ingress. Your application should serve traffic over HTTP, while external communication is secured via HTTPS.

### [Important Considerations](#important-considerations)

❗ **Security Warning:**

TLS is **terminated at the cluster boundary** when using `NGINX Ingress`. Communication within the cluster, especially within a single node, remains unencrypted. If full end-to-end encryption is required, you should:

- Omit the tls and annotations sections.

- Provide a certificate and key directly within your Pod.

❗ **Handling Mixed HTTP/HTTPS Configurations:**

Some applications may be confused when configured to use `HTTP` internally but exposed as `HTTPS`. If your application generates absolute URLs, ensure they use `HTTPS`.

-

`Ingress` sets the `HTTP_X_SCHEME` header to `HTTPS` when TLS is terminated.

-

However, many applications expect `X_FORWARDED_PROTO` instead (which Kubernetes `NGINX` does not set).
For example, in Django, you should set:

```
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_SCHEME", "https")

```

If your application requires HTTPS end-to-end, see the HTTPS Target section below.

---

### [Custom Domain Name (FQDN)](#custom-domain-name-fqdn)

It is possible to use a custom domain name instead of `*.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`.

-

Set up a `CNAME` DNS record.

- For the `kuba-cluster`, set the `CNAME` target to `kuba-pub.cerit-sc.cz`.

- For the `kubh-cluster`, set the `CNAME` target to `kubh-pub.cerit-sc.cz`.

-

Define an `Ingress` with the custom domain:

ingress.yaml

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: application-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "my-name"
      secretName: my-name-tls
  rules:
  - host: "my-name"
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: application-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific

```

📌
Note

The `CNAME` must be pre-set and propagated before requesting a TLS certificate. Let’s Encrypt requires domain verification, meaning seamless migration from another system to this infrastructure is not easily possible.

---

### [Authentication](#authentication)

You can secure access to your `Ingress`-exposed application by requiring user authentication. This is done using a `Secret` and `annotations`.

-

Create a Secret:

secret.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secretref
type: Opaque
data:
   auth: password

```

-

`secretref` is an arbitrary name.

-

The htpasswd output must be base64-encoded. To generate it:

```

```

htpasswd -n username | base64 -w0

```

This command returns a base64-encoded password string (like `Zm9vOiRhgvYTN2aktYSDEKCg=`), which should replace `password` in the `Secret`.

```

-

Add the following annotations to the Ingress:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: secretref

```

- `secretref` must match the metadata name of the `Secret`.

⚠️
Important

Authentication only applies to external traffic. Traffic from other pods within the cluster bypasses authentication when communicating directly with the `Service` IP. To enforce stricter access control, consider using `NetworkPolicy`. See the [Security section](./security).

---

### [Large Data Uploads](#large-data-uploads)

If your application expects large file uploads, you may need to modify `Ingress` settings to accommodate higher upload limits:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "600m"
nginx.org/client-max-body-size: "600m"

```

Replace `600m` with the desired maximum upload size.

---

### [HTTPS Target](#https-target)

If your application serves `HTTPS` traffic internally and you want to preserve encryption end-to-end, update your `Ingress` definition to include the following annotation:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"

```

This ensures that traffic between `Ingress` and the application remains encrypted. However, since the NGINX `Ingress` component terminates and re-encrypts the traffic, it does not provide true end-to-end encryption.

---

### [Limiting External Network Access](#limiting-external-network-access)

You can restrict access to your application at the `Ingress` level by limiting access to specific IP ranges using the `whitelist-source-range` annotation.

For example, to restrict access to only the **MUNI network**:

ingress.yaml

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: application-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: 147.251.0.0/16
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "my-name"
      secretName: my-name-tls
  rules:
  - host: "my-name"
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: application-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific

```

📌
Note

You can mix CIDRs (e.g., `147.251.0.0/16`), individual IP addresses (e.g., `147.251.17.148`), and both **IPv4** and **IPv6** addresses, all separated by commas. As IPv6 adoption continues to grow, be sure to include IPv6 addresses alongside IPv4 to maintain expected functionality.

---

### [Debugging: Certificate Not Issued](#debugging-certificate-not-issued)

If your configuration is correct but the TLS certificate is not issued, the problem may be due to resource quotas preventing the required ACME challenge pod from running.

#### [Steps to Debug](#steps-to-debug)

-

Check if the Ingress is stuck on the ACME solver:

```
kubectl get ingress -n [your_namespace]

```

If the output includes `cm-acme-http-solver` with an age of more than a few minutes, this likely indicates an issue.

```
> kubectl get ingress -n [your_namespace]
NAME                        CLASS    HOSTS                     ADDRESS                PORTS     AGE
cm-acme-http-solver-972p9   <none>   schema.biodata.ceitec.cz  kuba-pub.cerit-sc.cz   80        12m

```

-

Check for quota-related warnings:

```
kubectl get events -n [your_namespace]

```

Look for lines mentioning `exceeded quota`.

```
> kubectl get events -n [your_namespace] | grep cm-acme-http-solver
...
79s         Warning   PresentError   challenge/adamant-dyn-cloud-e-infra-cz-6dp4n-152868974-3440702542   (combined from similar events): Error presenting challenge: pods "cm-acme-http-solver-74szl" is forbidden: exceeded quota: default-kn7vq, requested: limits.cpu=100m, used: limits.cpu=1, limited: limits.cpu=1
...

```

If quota restrictions are the issue, you may need to:

- Increase the [namespace resource quota](../rancher/quotas#changing-namespace-quotas). Each ACME solver requires 100m CPUs and 100 MiB of memory.

- Remove some existing deployments.

You can also view events in the Rancher UI.

![acmesolver](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Facme-solver.0xe5wauahu2m0.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Custom Error Pages](#custom-error-pages)

By default, our NGINX Ingress Controller in Kubernetes intercepts HTTP errors **500 (Internal Server Error)** and **503 (Service Unavailable)** and displays a custom error page with brief instructions on how to resolve the issue. However, this behavior is often undesirable for applications that intentionally return these error codes, such as JSON-based REST APIs.

To allow the original error response to be passed to the client, you need to **disable the default error handling**. While it is not possible to completely disable error handling once it is globally enabled, you can **control which error codes are handled** using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/custom-http-errors` annotation.

#### [Solution](#solution)

Set the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/custom-http-errors` annotation to an **unused error code**, such as **599**, which effectively disables error handling for all other errors (including 500 and 503), as NGINX will only attempt to handle the specified error code (599).

#### [Example](#example)

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'true'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/custom-http-errors: '599'

```

With this configuration, NGINX will no longer intercept 500 and 503 errors, allowing the original error message from the application to be returned to the client.

---

## [Other Applications](#other-applications)

For applications that do not use the `HTTP` protocol, exposure is done via a `Service` without `Ingress`.

service.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  ports:
  - port: 22
    targetPort: 2222
  selector:
    app: application

```

- The `selector.app: application` must match the `Deployment`.

- If the annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` is set within `dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`, the name is automatically registered in DNS.

### [Checking the Assigned Public IP](#checking-the-assigned-public-ip)

Run:

```
kubectl get svc -n namespace

```

where `namespace` is the Namespace of the `Service`. The `IP` address will be displayed in the `EXTERNAL-IP` column.

### [Private MUNI IP](#private-muni-ip)

To expose the application only within the **MUNI network** or **MUNI VPN**, use the following `Service` annotation:

```
metallb.io/address-pool: privmuni

```

This method is preferred as it avoids consuming a public IP.

service.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc
  annotations:
    metallb.io/address-pool: privmuni
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  ports:
  - port: 22
    targetPort: 2222
  selector:
    app: application

```

### [LoadBalancer Firewall](#loadbalancer-firewall)

It is recommended to restrict external access to publicly exposed applications. This can be achieved either at the NetworkPolicy level (note that this works only when `externalTrafficPolicy` is set to `Local`) or by using the `loadBalancerSourceRanges` field in the `Service` object.

The example below demonstrates how to limit access to the network `147.251.0.0/16` and to a single IP address `1.2.3.4/32`. The `loadBalancerSourceRanges` field always expects values in CIDR notation, so even a single IP address must be expressed with a `/32` mask. If you are using both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, be aware that you must specify source ranges for both.

service.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc-rw
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: application-rw
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
  - 147.251.0.0/16
  - 1.2.3.4/32

```

### [Sharing an IP Address Across Multiple Services](#sharing-an-ip-address-across-multiple-services)

Since IPv4 addresses are a scarce resource, it’s beneficial to share a single IP address across multiple LoadBalancer services differentiated by port numbers. This can be accomplished by creating multiple `Service` objects and using the `metallb.io/allow-shared-ip` annotation to allocate a shared IP address.

The value of this annotation acts as a grouping key: all services with the same key will attempt to share the same IP address, provided it is possible. Therefore, choose a unique key for the annotation to avoid unintended IP sharing between unrelated services.

Below are examples of two LoadBalancer services configured to share the same IP address:

service1.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc-rw
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz
    metallb.io/allow-shared-ip: [my-shared-key-for-application]
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: application-rw

```

service2.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: application-svc-ro
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: application.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz
    metallb.io/allow-shared-ip: [my-shared-key-for-application]
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports:
  - port: 5433
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: application-ro

```

#### [Limitations](#limitations)

- If `externalTrafficPolicy` is set to `Local`, **all target Pods must be scheduled on the same node** to ensure accessibility.

- If `externalTrafficPolicy` is set to `Cluster`, **Pods can be distributed across multiple nodes**, which improves resilience and load distribution.
