## [Introduction](#introduction)

**DeepSec** is an **AI-powered vulnerability scanner** designed to run in your own infrastructure. It performs on-demand security reviews of entire codebases — including large-scale repositories — by combining fast regex-based candidate detection with deep AI investigation.

Unlike traditional static analysis tools, DeepSec uses AI agents to trace control flow, recognize authentication boundaries, and judge whether inputs are attacker-controlled. It is optimized to surface hard-to-find issues that have been lurking in applications for a long time, providing actionable findings with severity ratings and remediation recommendations.

DeepSec runs **exclusively on the e-INFRA CZ / CERIT-SC infrastructure**, ensuring:

- **Data security and privacy**

- Secure access through your **MetaCentrum account**.

## [Installation](#installation)

Download the latest Linux AMD64 binary from the Codeberg releases page:

👉 [https://codeberg.org/CERIT-SC/deepsec/releases](https://codeberg.org/CERIT-SC/deepsec/releases)

Place the binary in your `PATH` and make it executable:

```
chmod +x deepsec

```

Currently, only the **Linux AMD64** binary is provided.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

DeepSec requires an AI agent backend to perform investigations. You must have **at least one** of the following installed and available in your `PATH`:

### [Claude Code (recommended)](#claude-code-recommended)

Install the [Claude Code CLI](./llm-integration#claude-code) (`claude`). DeepSec will invoke it automatically when you pass `--agent claude`.

### [OpenAI Codex (default)](#openai-codex-default)

Install the [Codex CLI](./llm-integration#codex). It is the **default agent** when `--agent` is not specified — if you have `codex` installed, DeepSec will use it out of the box.

## [Configuration](#configuration)

No environment variables are required. DeepSec invokes the agent binaries (`claude` or `codex`) directly.

You **must always specify a model** via `--model`. DeepSec has a hardcoded fallback default (`claude-opus-4.7`) that does not exist on the e-INFRA CZ API and will fail if omitted.

| Model |Command flag |
| Kimi K2.6 |`--model kimi-k2.6` |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro Thinking |`--model deepseek-v4-pro-thinking` |
| Qwen 3.5 |`--model qwen3.5` |

Example command:

```
deepsec process --project-id my-app --agent claude --model kimi-k2.6

```

## [Usage](#usage)

Navigate to the root of the repository you want to scan and initialize DeepSec:

```
deepsec init       # creates .deepsec/ with this repo as the first project

```

Follow the instructions printed by `init`. A typical workflow then looks like:

```
cd .deepsec         # Yes, really, this new folder shall be created in the project directory
deepsec scan        # find candidate sites with regex matchers
deepsec process     # AI investigation; generates findings
deepsec revalidate  # optional, reduces false positives
deepsec export --format md-dir --out ./findings

```

For large codebases, work fans out automatically and interrupted runs resume where they left off when re-executed.

For detailed configuration options, see the [DeepSec documentation on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/CERIT-SC/deepsec).
